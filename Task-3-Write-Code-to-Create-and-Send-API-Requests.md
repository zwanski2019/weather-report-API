# Task 3 - Write Code to Create and Send API Requests

Write the JavaScript code that builds an HTTP request and sends it to the 7Timer! Server. It is recommended that you request data in JSON format since it is easier to work with JavaScript than XML.

If you are well versed in other JavaScript frameworks such as JQuery. You may opt to use it instead of plain JavaScript. Focus on connecting to the external server and getting results back in this step. Donâ€™t worry about formatting the results. Simply print it in the browser console or display the raw data on your page.

### Hint
- Most modern web browsers (including Google Chrome) have console displays that you can use to debug CSS and JavaScript.
- Remember that HTTP API is asynchronous, meaning you will not be getting the results back right away.
