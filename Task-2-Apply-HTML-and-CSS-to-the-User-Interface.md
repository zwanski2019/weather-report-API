# Task 2 - Apply HTML and CSS to the User Interface

Decide what input you need to gather from users to send to the external service. Do you want to use a dropdown list or find some other way to pass the latitude and longitude of a city along? (A CSV file with latitudes and longitudes of major European cities is included in the starter files).

Design the web page and user interface to accept user input and display results that you get back. If you are well versed in CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap. You may opt to use it.

Also, one of the important concepts of web design is to make your page “responsive”, meaning adapting to different device screen sizes so keep that in mind.

### Hints
- If you are using Visual Studio Code, the Live Server extension allows you to see the effects of your code in real time.
- Most modern web browsers (including Google Chrome) have console displays that you can use to debug CSS and JavaScript.
- Be sure to use images that you own or are royalty-free. Using graphics of unknown origin can lead to legal actions and undermine your credibility as a designer or developer. There are a lot of websites where you can find these. For example: Pixabay. You can also search for what you need by adding “royalty free” after the subject in any search engine. Some sites require attribution to use their images. Make sure you follow the instructions.
