# Task 1 - Explore the Weather Forecast API

The most important step is to explore the API service. What type of parameters do you want to pass along? What is the format of the results will you get back?

In this project, you will be using the 7Timer! API. It is free and does not require any API keys to work. Follow the link and see the different levels of services provided. You will probably be more interested in the Civil types.

You can use either a web browser (or optionally use an application like Postman) to send requests and examine the results.
