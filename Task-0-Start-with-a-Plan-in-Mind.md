# Task 0 - Start with a Plan in Mind

Start With A Plan in Mind
Before you begin, consider taking a step back to plan your steps. Properly planning your project, or scoping, will greatly benefit you; scoping creates structure while requiring you to think through your entire project before you begin. You should start by stating the goals for your project, then gathering the data, and considering the analytical steps required. A proper project scope can be a great road map for your project, but keep in mind that some analyses you start may become dead ends which will require you to adjust your plan.
