# Task 4 - Process Data and Generate HTML Results

Now it is time to generate the HTML and CSS code that you need to present the results in a way that the users can read. Write the necessary JavaScript to decode the data (JSON or XML) that you get back. Donâ€™t forget to handle any possible errors too.

### Hint
Most modern web browsers (including Google Chrome) have console displays that you can use to debug CSS and JavaScript.
