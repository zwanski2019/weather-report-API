# Task 6 - Use Fine-Tuning to Test Functionality

Thoroughly test your work and fine-tune any formatting or functionality issues. Make sure all external links work and all your JavaScript work as intended and free of errors. If possible, having someone else test your work might reveal bugs that you wonâ€™t find otherwise.

Finally, we can wrap up the project. You can write a conclusion about your process and any key findings.

### Hint
The main components that you will want to include:
- What did you learn throughout the process?
- Are the results what you expected?
- What are the key findings and takeaways?
